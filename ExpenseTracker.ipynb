    "- Consists of three classes: Individuals, Event and Fund.\n",
    "- Individuals class consists of each person in the group of friends. Only prompts for the instance of name\n",
    "- Event class class consists of the event the friends attended. Requires the instances details and participants\n",
    "- Event class contains the methods \"activity\" (to check if the payee is a participant, if so, adds them to the \"complete\" list). Otherwise prints to the effect that they have not signed up for the event.\n",
    "- Event class contains the method \"validate\" (called by \"activity\" to check the data entered is valid)\n",
    "- Event class contains the method \"reconcilliation_acc\" (to find the total cost, then divided by the number of participants to get how much each person owes. Prints to that effect. Adds participants who owe money to a list and participants who are owed money to a separate list. Calls the liability method.\n",
    "- The liability method within the Event class details who owes who money and prints to that effect\n",
    "- The fund class prompts for 4 instances, consisting of info, event, cost and payee."
